In this folder are some of the code using to analyze Molecular Dynamics simulation data during my PhD.
It contains the following:

- Silanizer : a program to graft surfaces with molecules and analyze MD trajectories.
  . It contains a class called New_System() which stores the trajectory information, and has access to several methods for analysis and transformations.
  . The program is currently limited for flat and cylindrical surfaces and with many specific code that can be generalized

- Analysis_Gases:
  . Notebook with partial analysis of results from simulations of intrusion-extrusion cycles of water diluted with different gases in silane-grafted nanopores.

- Analysis_PDMS:
  .Notebook with partial analysis of results from simulations of polydisperse and monodisperse PDMS-grafted surfaces.
